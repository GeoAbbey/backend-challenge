# Backend Challenge

Intelligent Innovations Confrence is looking for someone to design a RESTful API for talks at a conference.

## Requirements:

- Demonstrate use of REST conventions  
- Include routes to:  
	- add a talk  
	- add an attendee  
	- add an attendee to a talk
  - real-time chat among members of a talk
- Design a simple (not necessarily beautiful) user interface with framework/library of your choice to consume the API.
- Put solution on GitHub/BitBucket or any Git Server  
- Upload to webserver of choice e.g Heruko, Zeit, Netlify, AWS, or Digital Ocean 

## Bonuses:

- Use appropriate HTTP status codes.  
- Include a route to remove a talk. 

## What we are looking out for?

- Ability to understand the problem and work out a creative solution 
- Your code standard (function names, variable names, separation of concerns)
- Your Git Commits
- As much as a good design catches the eye, we are not judging you on that, rather the functionality.
